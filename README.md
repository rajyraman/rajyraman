### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Natraj
#### I work in the Power Platform

I am originally from India, but I currently live in Melbourne, Australia ðŸ¦˜. I am a walking stereotype of a typical Indian - I studied non-CS Engineering, but I currently work in the Tech industry. I started out as a Excel VBA Developer, and I encountered Dynamics CRM (as it was known back then) by accident on an internal project. Ever since, I have continued to work in the Dynamics 365/Power Platform ecosystem. Over the past few years, I have also been focussing on Microsoft Azure, as there are more and more projects that need both Azure and Power Platform skills. I love getting out of my comfort zone and explore something new, failing, keep failing and eventually learn it. I remember random useless facts and big fan of aviation ðŸ›«.
